# **STEM-KG: Building a Knowledge Graph for STEM Education**

## **Project Overview**
This repository contains the scripts and resources for a master's thesis project that aims to construct a **knowledge graph (KG) for STEM education**. The project focuses on:
- **Extracting scientific concepts** from Flemish *eindtermen* (educational standards) and *leerplannen* (curricula).
- **Retrieving relevant relationships** from **Wikidata** and **DBpedia** to build a structured knowledge base.
- **Validating** the extracted concepts and relations with education professionals.
- **Constructing a master knowledge graph (KG)** that enables filtering by subject, grade level, and more.
- *(Optional, if time permits)* **Integrating the KG into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system** for a STEM teacher support chatbot.

## **Team & Supervision**
This project is conducted as a collaboration between two master’s students:
- **Bert Vos** (Master of Advanced Studies in Linguistics, NLP specialization, Ghent University & KU Leuven)
- **Ecem Sila Gök** (Master of Artificial Intelligence, Engineering & Computer Science specialization, KU Leuven)

The research is carried out under the supervision of:
- **Prof. Hanne Deprez** (KU Leuven)
- **Prof. Orphée De Clercq** (UGent)
- **Dr. Tom Vermeulen** (Brainjar)

Daily supervision is provided by **Aagje Reynders (Brainjar).**  
The project is conducted in collaboration with **Brainjar, KU Leuven, and UGent**.

## **How to Contribute**
Since this repository is private, only authorized contributors have access.  
For collaboration, follow these best practices:
1. **Use feature branches**: Each new feature or update should be developed in a separate branch before merging.
2. **Commit messages**: Follow a clear format (e.g., `feat: added relation extraction script` or `fix: corrected Wikidata query bug`).
3. **Documentation**: Always update README or docs when adding new scripts or methodologies.
4. **Pull requests & code review**: Changes should be reviewed by both contributors before merging to `main`.

## **Technical Requirements**
Technical Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Conda environment setup:
  Install the required dependencies using Conda:
  
     conda env create -f requirements.yml
  
     conda activate mp_kg_rag_chat

Ollama and Required Model
This project also requires Ollama and the Mistral-7B-Instruct v0.2 (Q4_0) model.

1. Install Ollama:
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

2. Download the required model:
   ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct-v0.2-q4_0

3. Ensure Ollama is running before using the script:
   ollama serve

For more details on setting up Ollama, visit: https://ollama.com/docs


## **Future Plans**
- Completing **concept extraction** and **relation extraction** pipelines.
- Constructing and validating the **master knowledge graph**.
- *(Optional)* Experimenting with **RAG integration** for a chatbot prototype.
